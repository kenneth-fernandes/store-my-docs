# store-my-docs
Store My Docs is a simple web application built with React (frontend) and Python (Flask/FastAPI) (backend) that allows users to upload, store, and manage documents securely on AWS cloud storage (S3). It uses PostgreSQL on AWS RDS for metadata storage and is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with Nginx and Gunicorn for efficient hosting.
